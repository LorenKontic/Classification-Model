In this project classification model of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency price direction was analyzed using the results of the sentiment analysis of the text scraped from the Bitcointalk online forum.
Text sentiment analysis data was used as part of the input data set to predict the rise or fall of the cryptocurrency price, which is a comparison of the day's closing price compared to tomorrow's closing price,
which represents the output variable of the binary classification. Binary classification was performed using three different models in order to be able to compare the classification performance between them.
The classification performance between the models will be compared using ROC curves, confusion matrices and the results of other performance measures.
The models used in the binary classification problem are: Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boost Classifier and Support Vector Classifier
